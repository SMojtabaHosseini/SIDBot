A Discord bot to search space id domains.
Just send the command !name {domain-name} and wait to get the result. Put the name you want to search its availability instead of {domain-name}. Names should be without .bnb
For example !name amazon returns : "domain amazon.bnb is not available" 

Powered by spaceid api


This bot is live on repl.it, so we need to have keep_alive.py file
starter.py is for discord limitations
